Abstract
Background and objective
Extramammary Paget disease EMPD has seldom been studied in Mediterranean populations 
We aimed to review the characteristics of our patients with EMPD the presence of a neoplasm in continuity 
and the longterm course of the disease
Patients and methods
Retrospective observational study of 27 patients diagnosed with EMPD between 1990 and 2015 All clinical and pathology findings related to clinical course and outcomes were retrieved for analysis
Results
Twenty patients were women and 7 were men Ages ranged from 42 to 88 years median 76 years Lesions were in the following locations vulva 16 cases pubisgroin 5 perianal region 4 and axilla 2 
Time from onset to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 60 months median 12 months and maximum lesion diameter from 20 to 140 mm median 55 mm 
In 3 cases 111 EMPD was a secondary condition None of the lesions developed on a previous cutaneous adnexal adenocarcinoma 
Ten of the 24 primary EMPDs 417 invaded the dermis Eight of the 27 patients 296 experienced local recurrence after the initial surgical treatment
 Three patients 111 died as a consequence of metastasis from the EMPD
Conclusions
The presence of an underlying cutaneous adnexal adenocarcinoma is uncommon but it is not unusual to find an extracutaneous adenocarcinoma in continuity Although EMPD is a slowgrowing tumor dermal invasion is frequent and metastasis is not uncommon Local recurrence is common even after excision with wide margins and may be delated so long term followup is essential
